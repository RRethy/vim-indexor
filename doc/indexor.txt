INTRODUCTION                                    *indexor*

This plugin is a tool for indices to lists. It will prepend a group of lines
with numbers, and lower/upper case letters.

Consider have a grocery list as follows:

  Bananas
  Oranges
  Milk
  Maple Syrup
  Dried Mango

To number this list, it would require a lot of typing, or perhaps a fancy
macro using |CTRL-A| which is not ideal. Instead, you can highlight the lines
that need to be indexed, and |indexor| will add numbers (or letters) to the
lines. This will result in the list above being changed into the following:

  1. Bananas
  2. Oranges
  3. Milk
  4. Maple Syrup
  5. Dried Mango

MAPPINGS                                        *indexor-mappings*

Add numbers as the indices with <Leader>n
Add lowercase letters as the indices with <Leader>l
Add uppercase letters as the indices with <Leader>L

These will all add the appropriate index with a '. ' to the start of the text
on the line (Not the start of the line).

NOTES                                           *indexor-notes*

For indexing with letters, it has a cap of 26 items. This will change in the
future to start doubling up on letters.

CUSTOMIZING                                     *indexor-customizing*

You can define your own mappings for all three mentioned above as follows:

vmap <Leader>n <Plug>IndexorAdd_numbers
vmap <Leader>l <Plug>IndexorAdd_lowercase_letters
vmap <Leader>L <Plug>IndexorAdd_uppercase_letters

Using your mappings instead of the default.
